Starfire v0.0.1
========================

Starfire is a simple experiment combining the physics library, Pymunk, 
with Pyxel, a library for simple game development. Starfire introduces
a class of simple simulated bodies closely resembling a "fireball" and 
their behavior in a sparse environment. 

You can execute the simulation by executing

``python -m starfire``

once the simulation is running you can modify the angle and velocity of any "fireball"
you spawn with the [arrow keys], you may press the [SpaceBar] to spawn a "fireball" and propel
it forward, while the [Left Control] key is held press the [SpaceBar] to spawn a "fireball" 
which will orbit a point at the center of the screen, if while any fireball is in flight the [E]
key is pressed all "fireballs" on the screen will combust.
